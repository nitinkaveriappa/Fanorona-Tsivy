# Project-Fan
Fanorona is a strategy board game for two players and is indigenous to Madagascar. Fanorona-Tsivy is the most popular amongst all the versions. Black and white pieces, twenty-two each, are arranged on all points but the center. The objective of the game is to capture all the opponents pieces. The game is a draw if neither player succeeds in this. Capturing is done by either approaching or withdrawing from opponent's pieces.
